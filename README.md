# Hello, hello! ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to my humble abode! I'm a student looking to compile my projects to showcase my journey in development.

## Studying...

<img align="left" alt="JavaScript icon" style="height: 32px;" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/devicons/devicon/icons/javascript/javascript-original.svg" />
<img align="left" alt="Tailwind CSS icon" style="height: 32px;" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/devicons/devicon/icons/tailwindcss/tailwindcss-plain.svg" />
<img align="left" alt="SCSS icon" style="height: 32px;" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/devicons/devicon/icons/sass/sass-original.svg" />

### Web Development
Front-end-wise, My current goals are improving accessibility by writing more semantically-correct code.

It's an uphill climb that's well-worth it. Laying out semantic purpose <span style="color: red;">(meaning)</span> will not only assist assistive technology to better _assist the user_ (and what more do we want as developers?) but also help future-proof messy or (meaningless) code.

Besides that, I'm trying to get used to **Tailwind CSS** and **SCSS**.

## Interested in...
<img align="left" alt="TypeScript icon" style="height: 32px;" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/devicons/devicon/icons/typescript/typescript-original.svg" />
<img align="left" alt="React icon" style="height: 32px;" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/devicons/devicon/icons/react/react-original.svg" />
<img align="left" alt="Node.js icon" style="height: 32px;" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/devicons/devicon/icons/nodejs/nodejs-original.svg" />

### Web Development
I'm barely holding myself back from learning **TypeScript** and JS libraries like **React** and **Node.js**. Something tells me I should familiarize myself with vanilla JS more, however.

<img align="left" alt="C programming language icon" style="height: 32px;" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/devicons/devicon/icons/c/c-original.svg" />
<img align="left" alt="Python icon" style="height: 32px;" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/devicons/devicon/icons/python/python-original.svg" />
<img align="left" alt="C-plus-plus programming language icon" style="height: 32px;" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/devicons/devicon/icons/cplusplus/cplusplus-original.svg" />

### Software Development
I want to try my hand at **C** for a more robust understanding of Systems in general. **Python** for general-purpose software and automation, but right now, I'm most eager to see and learn its role in web apps. That, and seeing the core concepts and skills carry over to **C++**, for embedded devices and/or robotics.

## Socials
Pending! I'm going to try my hand at YouTube one day. Nothing fancy. Much like Github, I'll use it to document my development journey. I'll stick to the major projects and passions for it, though.

# Fare thee well
Well, that's all for now. Until next time! ðŸ‘‹
